      <p>Who is that guy? I am from Colorado, and I say there aren't many places to go to from here. I grew up in Boulder and Broomfield. I have been working since the age of 14 and working for my fathers limo company since 19. I have been driving the rich and famous around for 10 years, and although I love most of the people I drive, I am ready for a change. </p>
      <p>I have three kids, one boy and two weddings. My son is 11 and girls are 8 and 5. I have been married for 12 years...to the same woman. My son loves sports and school. And unlike me he loves to read. Almost more than sports. My girls are very girly, unlike me. They love music and dancing. </p>
